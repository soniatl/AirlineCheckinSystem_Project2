# AirlineCheckinSystem_Project2
My project is to operate an Airline Check-in that checks passengers' identification and collects baggage before boarding a flight. I want to create a more efficient check-in system where passengers can skip the counter and use the self-check-in kiosk if they only have a carry-on.
